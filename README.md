**IoU (Intersection over Union) is a metric used to evaluate the accuracy of predicted bounding boxes or segmentation masks in comparison to ground truth data. Here's a breakdown:**

Formula:

**IoU = Area of Overlap / Area of Union**

**Area of Overlap:** The area where the predicted bounding box/mask and the ground truth box/mask intersect.   
**Area of Union:** The total area covered by both the predicted and ground truth boxes/masks.

**Range of IoU**

* IoU ranges from 0 to 1:
   * **IoU =** 0: No overlap.
   * **IoU =** 1: Perfect overlap.
  
**Use Cases**

**Object Detection:** IoU is used to determine if a predicted bounding box is a true positive (e.g., IoU â‰¥ 0.5 might be the threshold for a correct detection).

**Image Segmentation:** Measures the quality of predicted segmentation masks.![Screenshot 2024-12-22 075452](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d1a0950-c99c-4c12-bc03-4c8e68b4a8e1)
